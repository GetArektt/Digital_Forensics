## Digital forensics laboratory classes of AGH UST course.
These classes provide hands-on experience in the acquisition, analysis, and presentation of digital evidence. The lab classes typically involve the use of specialized open-source software, as well as real-world scenarios that simulate digital forensic investigations.
This is a summary of my take on handling digital forensics laboratory classes assigments divided into 7 PDF files:

1) Extracting information from images
2) EwfTools+Rarcrack
3) Base64/ASCII
4) File recovery and data carving
5) Networking traffic analysis
6) Operating system memory analysis
7) Big data image analysis
