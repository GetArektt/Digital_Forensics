# Digital_Forensics
Collection of resources materials and my own work that have been used in the learning path of digital forensics labolatory classes on AGH UST. These classes provide hands-on experience in the acquisition, analysis, and presentation of digital evidence. The lab classes typically involve the use of specialized open-source software, as well as real-world scenarios that simulate digital forensic investigations.
